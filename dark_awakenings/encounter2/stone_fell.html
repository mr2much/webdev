            You’re disoriented in churning water for a few seconds, then you
            manage to stand just as Gungurk falls, squealing, into the chasm
            with you. He lands face first into a shallow pool of water.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you start observing your surroundings, you realize that you’re in
            a large cave. Ambient green light allows you to see clearly. The
            chasm is above you now, an opening in the cave roof about 10 feet
            up. You’re in a luminous green stream of water that flows from a
            hole in the northern cave wall, and the cave slopes upward toward
            that direction. The current is pretty strong. Part of the cave to
            the west is obviously hewn stone, and another stream flows from that
            passage. From your vantage, you can’t see much of that tunnel.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a squelching sound, a sickly-looking blue ooze surfaces and
            starts to approach. Movement in other parts of the cave indicates
            more creatures, including a couple of those black, mobile roots near
            the southern wall. The stream plunges into another cavern there,
            roiling fiercely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nearby, a long, inanimate root dangles in the water, looking like
            you could swing on it or hold onto it.
