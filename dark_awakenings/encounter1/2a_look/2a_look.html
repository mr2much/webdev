            Desperate, you start looking around for something to grab on to,
            until you feel the vines tugging at your legs, trying to drag you
            closer towards the deep chasm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within your reach, you see the handle of the hand axe, that you use
            for carving wood in your free time, poking from atop a table. It is
            not suited for combat but could be useful in this situation?
          </p>
          <p>
            You also notice that you are close to the entrance to your tent, you
            remember that it is very sturdy and that the pitons you used to set
            it up are firmly nailed on the ground, so you think that if you
            allow the vine to drag you a bit closer to it, then you can grab on
            to the tent and use it to pull yourself out of the vine's grasp.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever you're going to do, you have to decide, and decide now!
            There is no time to waste! You must act quickly!
