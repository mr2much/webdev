            You extend your arm behind you, drawing back your handaxe. Your
            muscles tense up and you let out a scream as your axe draws a sharp
            arc in the air and the light flickers on its edge as it travels
            towards its target. With a dull thud, you manage to cut the vine
            and, just as before, you watch it shrivel and turn black, falling
            limply on the ground at your feet.
          </p>

            Gungurk celebrates and thanks you for saving his life.

            You notice the other vines slithering as they appear to come for the
            both of you, with a gesture of your hand you prompt him to stop and
            point at the vines with your weapon. You know there is no time to
            relax.
