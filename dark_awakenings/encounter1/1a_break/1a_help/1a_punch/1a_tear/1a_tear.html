            Pulling your arms back and closing your fingers into a fist, you
            lunge forward, releasing a powerful blow on the vine, then another,
            and a third one. You feel all your hits connecting with the strength
            that characterizes you, but the thing keeps your friend tightly
            wrapped and keeps pulling him as if nothing happened.
