            You close your eyes and take a slow but deep breath. Gritting your
            teeth, veins start popping up on your arms and forehead as you flex
            your muscles and pull on the vine wrapped around your body with all
            your strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            The vine tries squeezing you but it's all for naught. You manage to
            tear free from its grasp.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pieces that kept you restrained lie harmlessly next to you,
            while the rest of it starts shriveling, and squirming as it turns
            black, going completely still after a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jumping to your feet, you start to look at your surroundings,
            noticing that there are five more of those strange vines writhing
            closer. Gungurk squeals again as he is dragged 5 feet closer towards
            the chasm.
