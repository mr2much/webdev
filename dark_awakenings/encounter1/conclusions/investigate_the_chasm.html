            The chasm wall ends after about 10 feet, but it opens into a wider
            area lit by a green light. The light shimmers on running water about
            20 feet below.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the far side of the chasm dangles a root that could allow easy
            climbing. You would need to jump about 10 feet to reach that root.
          </p>
          <p>
            Otherwise, the chasm sides look rough, and there's no reason to risk
            a jump to the chasm's other side other than to make use of the root
            there.
