            Without a single trace of remorse in your heart (or maybe a little),
            you abandon your friends to their fates. Will you have nightmares
            thinking about your actions in the future? Only you know the answer
            to that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of what it may be, you decided to continue your journey
            alone. Maybe along the way you will find a new group of companions
            willing to travel alongside you, or maybe these events will make you
            someone infamous for abandoning your closest friends, causing other
            adventuring groups to ostracize and despize you. Only time can tell.
          </p>
