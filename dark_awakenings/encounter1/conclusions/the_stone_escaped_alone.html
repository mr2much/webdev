            You escape the frightful campsite and make it back to a nearby town.
            After a night in a warm inn bed, you awaken with your memory intact
            and the realization that you left your comrades to an unknown fate
            in the chasm.
          </p>
          <p>
            You have an important decision to make, you can either return to the
            chasm to rescue them or abandon them and move on with your life.
