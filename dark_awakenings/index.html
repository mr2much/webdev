          <p>
            You dream of shaking earth and screams, the smell of rot and dark
            laughter. Burning eyes glare back at you in the dream. The vision
            changes with the smell of turned earth and wet leaves and a crushing
            weight on your chest. You feel warmth nearby and see a source of
            blurred, yellow light. Then something cracks loudly, followed by a
            shrill scream.
          </p>
          <p>
            You wake with a start, still in your bedroll, and realize a thin,
            black root grasps you by your legs and torso. It’s pulling you
            toward a large chasm in the ground on one side of what appears to be
            a ransacked campsite under a looming hillside on all sides except
            the east. The warm light turns out to be a campfire in the dimness
            of dawn, crackling as it slowly dies. Other roots reach out through
            the camp.
          </p>
          <p>
            You remember that someone else should be here, your companions, but
            you know little else, especially why you’re here. Another shrill
            scream draws your eye to a small form struggling with another vine.
            It’s a goblin in rather fine clothing and armor for his ilk.
          </p>
          <p>
            His bulging eyes fall on you. “Please, Mr.
            <span>Stone</span>, help us, poor <span>Gungurk</span>! Please!” He
            says a name, and you remember that it’s yours and that Gungurk is
            your friend. You are both around 20 feet away from the edge of the
            hole. It’s time to act, none of you have your weapons drawn, but
            your hands are free.
          </p>
