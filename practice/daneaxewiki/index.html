              The <strong>Dane axe</strong> is an early type of
              <a href="#">battle axe</a>, primarily used during the transition
              between the European <a href="#">Viking Age</a> and early
              <a href="#">Middle Ages</a>. Other names for the weapon include
              English long axe, Danish axe, and hafted axe.

          <h2>Construction</h2>
          <p>
            Most axes, both in period illustrations and extant artifact, that
            fall under the description of Danish axe possess type L or type M
            heads according to the Petersen axe typology.[1] Both types consist
            of a wide, thin blade, with pronounced "horns" at both the toe and
            heel of the bit. Cutting surfaces vary, but is generally between 20
            and 30 cm (8 and 12 in). Type L blades tend to be smaller, with the
            toe of the bit swept forward for superior shearing capability. Later
            type M blades are typically larger overall, with a more symmetrical
            toe and heel.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blade itself was reasonably light and forged very thin, making
            it superb for cutting. The thickness of the body on top the edge is
            as thin as 2 mm. Many of these axes were constructed with a
            reinforced bit, typically of a higher carbon steel to facilitate a
            harder, sharper edge. Average weight of an axe this size is between
            1 and 2 kg (2.2 and 4.4 lb). Proportionally, the long axe has more
            in common with a modern meat cleaver than a wood axe. This complex
            construction (i.e. forged thin and incorporating a harder type of
            steel near the edge) results in a lively and quick weapon with
            devastating cutting ability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on period depictions, the haft of a longaxe for combat was
            usually between approx. 0.9 and 1.2 m (3.0 and 3.9 ft) long,
            although Dane axes used as status symbols might be as long as 1.5 to
            1.7 m (5 to 5½ ft). Such axes might also feature inlaid silver and
            frequently do not have the flared steel edge of a weapon designed
            for war. Some surviving examples also feature a brass haft cap,
            often richly decorated, which presumably served to keep the head of
            the weapon secure on the haft, as well as protecting the end of the
            haft from the rigours of battle. Ash and oak are the most likely
            materials for the haft, as they have always been the primary
            materials used for polearms in Europe.

              A Dane axe on the <a href="#">Bayeux Tapestry</a>

          </div>
          <p>
            A Dane axe on the Bayeux Tapestry Through the course of the
            10th–11th centuries, the Dane axe gained popularity in areas outside
            Scandinavia where Viking influence was strong, such as England,
            Ireland and Normandy. Historical accounts depict the Dane axe as the
            weapon of the warrior elite in this period, such as the Huscarls of
            Anglo-Saxon England.[citation needed] In the Bayeux tapestry, a
            visual record of the ascent of William the Conqueror to the throne
            of England, the axe is almost exclusively wielded by well armoured
            huscarls. These huscarls formed the core bodyguard of King Harold at
            the Battle of Hastings. A Dane axe, perhaps King Edward's, is
            offered to Harold before he is crowned.[2] The Bayeux Tapestry also
            depicts a huscarl cleaving a Norman knight's horse's head with one
            blow.[3] The Dane axe is also known to have been used by the
            Varangian Guard, also known as pelekyphoros phroura (πελεκυφόρος
            φρουρά), the "axe-bearing guard". One surviving ivory plaque from
            the 10th century Constantinople depicts a Varangian holding an axe
            that is at least as tall as its wielder.[citation needed]
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the name retains its Scandinavian heritage, the Dane axe
            became widely used throughout Europe from the 12th century, as axes
            gained acceptance as a knightly weapon, albeit not achieving the
            status of the sword.[4] They also began to be used widely as an
            infantry polearm, with the haft lengthening to about 6 feet (1.8
            m).[5][6] The 13th and 14th centuries also saw form changes, with
            the blade also lengthening, the rear horn extending to touch or
            attach to the haft. The lengthened weapon, especially if combined
            with the lengthened blade, was called a sparth in England. Some
            believe this weapon is the ancestor of the halberd.[7]
          </p>
          <p>
            While the use of the Dane axe continued into the 14th. century, axes
            with an armour piercing back-spike and spear-like spike on the
            fore-end of the haft became more common, eventually evolving into
            the pollaxe in the 15th century.[8] The simple Danish axe continued
            to be used in the West of Scotland and in Ireland into the 16th
            century.[9] In Ireland, it was particularly associated with
            gallowglass mercenaries.[10]

            After the Battle of Stiklestad, the axe also became the symbol of
            St. Olaf and can still be seen on the Coat of Arms of Norway.
            However, this is because the axe is the implement of his martyrdom,
            rather than signifying use.[citation needed] King Stephen of England
            famously used a Danish axe at the Battle of Lincoln 1141. While one
            account says after his sword broke,[11] another says he used his
            sword only after his axe broke.[12] Richard the Lionheart was often
            recorded in Victorian times wielding a large war axe, though
            references are sometimes wildly exaggerated as befitted a national
            hero:

            Richard is, however, recorded as using a Danish Axe at the relief of
            Jaffa.[14] Geoffrey de Lusignan is another famous crusader
            associated with the axe.[15]
          </p>
          <p>
            Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, famously killed Henry de Bohun
            at the Battle of Bannockburn with a single blow of his axe. The blow
            was so powerful it split de Bohun's helmet and skull open and
            snapped the shaft of the axe.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 14th century, the use of axes is increasingly noted by
            Froissart in his Chronicle,[16] with King John II using one at the
            Battle of Poitiers in 1356 and Sir James Douglas at the Battle of
            Otterburn in 1388. Bretons were apparently noted axe users, with
            Bertrand du Guesclin and Olivier de Clisson both wielding axes in
            battle.[17] In these cases, it is uncertain whether the weapon was a
            Danish axe, or the proto-pollaxe.
