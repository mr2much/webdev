## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

For the first time ever, I managed to use the ``background`` property to set various stuff at the same time, like the images at the top and bottom as well as the background color. I had to read some documentation on MDN since I didn't want to google around code snippets on Stack Overflow. Positioning the images took me a few minutes and was not as straight forward as just setting ``left top`` or ``right bottom``.

Here's how I did it:

```css
background: left -90% top 60% / 75% no-repeat url("../images/bg-pattern-top.svg"),
    right -90% top -40% / 75% no-repeat url("../images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg"),
    hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
```

Positioning the image to look like the one in the example was a lot trickier than I thought, and despite my best efforts, I had to do some googling to see how it was done. At first I was trying to do some ``position: relative`` to set it relative to its parent container, as if trying to position the image between two divs, but then I realized that there was no other div in the first place. In the end, what I found didn't work because of the layout on the HTML, so I added another div, set the image as its background, and then another div with the information. Then it was only a matter of making the div with the image round, adding a bit of negative marging on the top, and then setting the image to occupy 100% of the space inside of the div. Here is the HTML:

```html
<!-- This is inside of a parent .card container -->
      <div class="heading"></div>
      <div class="main">
        <div class="img"></div>
        <div class="info">
          <p><span class="name">Victor Crest</span> 26</p>
          <p>London</p>
        </div>
      </div>
<!-- This is inside of a parent .card container -->
```

And here is the CSS:

```css
.card .img {
  border: 0.35em solid #fff;
  background: center / cover url("../images/image-victor.jpg");
  position: relative;
  top: -48px;
  border-radius: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 106px;
  height: 106px;
}
```


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
