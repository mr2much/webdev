# Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mr2much/webdev/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## CatPhotoApp

When you start with the basic HTML and CSS part of the freecodecamp's curriculum, one of the first things they teach you how to build is the CatPhotoApp. For fun, and for practice, I just kept adding stuff to it as I learned, and then published on GitHub Pages just to learn how to do it. You can see the CatPhotoApp's website [Here](https://mr2much.github.io/webdev/catphotoapp/html/practice)

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mr2much/webdev/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
