						<li>It confuses students by presenting an incoherent and easily forgettable ensemble of information</li>
						<li>It teaches them to accept their class affiliation</li>
						<li>It makes them indifferent</li>

						<li>It teaches them a kind of self-confidence that requires constant confirmation by experts</li>
