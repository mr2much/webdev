    <h1>Boxing Styles</h1>
    <h2>Primary styles</h2>
    <p>
      There are four generally accepted boxing styles that are used to define
      fighters. These are the swarmer, out-boxer, slugger, and boxer-puncher.
      Many boxers do not always fit into these categories, and it's not uncommon
      for a fighter to change their style over a period of time.
    </p>
    <h3>Swarmer</h3>
    <p>
      The swarmer (in-fighter, crowder) is a fighter who attempts to overwhelm
      his opponent by applying constant pressure — taking away an opponent's
      usually superior reach. Swarmers tend to have very good head movement in
      order to get inside. Good power, a good chin, and a tremendous punch
      output (resulting in a great need for stamina and conditioning). This
      style favors closing inside an opponent, overwhelming them with intensity
      and flurries of hooks and uppercuts. They tend to be fast on their feet
      which can make them difficult to evade for a slower fighter; or are great
      at cutting off the ring with precise footwork. They also tend to have a
      good "chin" because this style usually involves being hit with many jabs
      before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. Many
      swarmers are often either shorter fighters or fighters with shorter
      reaches, especially in the heavier classes, that have to get in close to
      be effective.
    </p>
    <h3>Out-boxer</h3>
    <p>
      The out-boxer (out-fighter, boxer) is the opposite of the swarmer. The
      out-boxer seeks to maintain a gap from their opponent and fight with
      faster, longer range punches. Out-boxers are known for being extremely
      quick on their feet, which often makes up for a lack of power. Since they
      rely on the weaker jabs and straights (as opposed to hooks and uppercuts),
      they tend to win by points decisions rather than by knockout, although
      some out-boxers can be aggressive and effective punchers.
    </p>
    <h3>Slugger</h3>
    <p>
      If the out-boxer represents everything elegant about boxing, the slugger
      (brawler, puncher) embodies everything brutal about the sport. Many
      sluggers tend to lack finesse in the ring, but make up for it in raw
      power, often able to knock almost any opponent out with a single punch.
      Sluggers' punches are often slow but have more body and follow through.
      This is advantageous in punching through an opponent’s guard and creating
      an opportunity to follow with further blows. Most sluggers lack mobility
      in the ring and may have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on
      their feet but that's not always the case. Compared to swarmers and
      out-boxers, sluggers normally throw fewer but harder shots and rely less
      on combinations. Sluggers often throw predictable punching patterns
      (single punches with obvious leads) which can leave them open for
      counterpunching.
    </p>
    <h3>Boxer-puncher</h3>
    <p>
      The boxer-puncher possesses many of the qualities of the out-boxer: hand
      speed, often an outstanding jab combination, and/or counter-punching
      skills, better defense and accuracy than a slugger, while possessing
      slugger type power. The Boxer-puncher may also be more willing to fight in
      an aggressive swarmer-style than an out-boxer. In general the
      boxer-puncher lacks the mobility and defensive expertise of the pure
      boxer. Boxer-punchers usually do well against out-boxers, especially if
      they can match their speed and mobility. They also tend to match up well
      against swarmers, because the extra power often discourages the swarmer's
      aggression. Boxer-punchers can be hard to categorize since they can be
      closer in style to a slugger, swarmer, or an out-boxer.
    </p>
    <h2>Sub-styles and other categories</h2>
    <h3>Counterpuncher</h3>
    <p>
      A counterpuncher utilizes techniques that require the opposing boxer to
      make a mistake, and then capitalizing on that mistake. A skilled
      counterpuncher can utilize such techniques as winning rounds with the jab
      or <a href="#">psychological</a> tactics to entice an opponent to fall
      into an aggressive style that will exhaust him and leave him open for
      counterpunches. For these reasons this form of boxing balances defense and
      offense but can lead to severe damage if the boxer who utilizes this
      technique has bad reflexes or isn't quick enough.
    </p>
    <h3>Southpaw</h3>
    <p>
      A southpaw fights with a left‐handed fighting stance as opposed to an
      orthodox fighter who fights right‐handed. Orthodox fighters lead and jab
      from their left side, and southpaw fighters will jab and lead from their
      right side. Orthodox fighters hook more with their left and cross more
      with their right, and vice versa for southpaw fighters. Some naturally
      right-handed fighters (such as Marvin Hagler and Michael Moorer)[2][3]
      have converted to southpaw in the past to offset their opponents.
    </p>
    <h3>Switch-Hitter</h3>
    <p>
      A switch-hitter switches back and forth between a right-handed (orthodox)
      stance and a left-handed (southpaw) stance on purpose to confuse their
      opponents in a fight. Right-handed boxers would train in the left-handed
      (southpaw) stance, while southpaws would train in a right-handed
      (orthodox) stance, gaining the ability to switch back and forth after much
      training. A truly ambidextrous boxer can naturally fight in the
      switch-hitter style without as much training.
